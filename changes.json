    "Some under-the-hood improvements, to make Bastion even better."

  "FIXES": [
    "Danny wanted to show his friends his Rainbow 6 stats. But Danny noticed that his death count and assists were always same and was confused. We don't want anyone to stay confused. So, we fixed the `rainbow6` command.",
    "Cara tried to set multiple statuses, but Bastion was unable to cycle between them, so she got upset. We can't let anyone down, so we fixed that too!",
    "Some under-the-hood fixes, as usual, to improve Bastion."
