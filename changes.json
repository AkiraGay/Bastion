  "NEW STUFF": [
    "You can now use the `resetProfile` command to reset any user's profile, provided that you've Manage Server permissions.",
    "If your server has a huge amount of users, sometimes you might have noticed that a few features (like level up roles) doesn't seem to work for a few users. That's become some user's are not in Bastion's cache. So, to get around that, the `cacheMembers` command was added. It can be used by server managers for caching all the members of the server.",
    "You can now gamble on slots machine. Use the new `betSlots` command to satisfy your gambling needs!"
  ],
  "IMPROVEMENTS": [
    "The `google` command will now show more accurate search results.",
    "You will now be able to see the correct answer to the jumbed word, after the game is over. No more wondering what the correct answer was!",
    "The `profile` command has been tweaked a bit. Try it to find out.",
    "Bastion will now show warning messages if a message is filtered because of forbidden words. No more silently deleting the messages.",
    "And if a message gets filtered because of a blocked word, it'll log the block word that triggered the filter.",
    "The `clear` command now accepts an `user` option which can be used to pass user IDs. It's useful when you want to clear messages from someone who has left the server, because you can't mention them anymore."
  ],
  "KILLED THESE BUGS": [
    "Fixed the `levelUpRoles` command showing the **Level null** for some roles that weren't assigned any level.",
    "The `poll` command can now run for exactly 24 hours! For people who hadn't noticed, it only allowed you to run for 23 hours and 59 minutes.",
    "Fixed the `google` command not showing any search results.",
    "Some under-the-hood fixes, as usual."
