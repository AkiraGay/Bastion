    "You can now use the `resetProfile` command to reset any user's profile, provided that you've Manage Server permissions.",
    "If your server has a huge amount of users, sometimes you might have noticed that a few features (like level up roles) doesn't seem to work for a few users. That's become some user's are not in Bastion's cache. So, to get around that, the `cacheMembers` command was added. It can be used by server managers for caching all the members of the server."
