  "IMPROVEMENTS": [
    "Bastion's autoplay will now play daily hits instead of weekly hits. Daily music listeners won't get bored of the same songs anymore."
  ],
  "KILLED THOSE BUGS": [
    "Fixed `showSpoiler` command not decoding the spoilers for you!",
    "Fixed an issue with auto-assignable roles being assigned at a delay if greet timeout was set.",
    "Fixed an issue that prevented the default greet & farewell messages from being shown. Bastion wanted to have a custom message for those. But not anymore!"
