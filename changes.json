  "KILLED THESE BUGS": [
    "Killed a bug that posted the announcement messages, announced through announcement reactions, in the current channel instead of the announcement channel.",
    "Killed another bug that prevented the `addWhitelistDomains` from working.",
    "There was another bug that prevented the `stats` command from working if an invalid owner ID was set in the credentials. Killed that too!"
