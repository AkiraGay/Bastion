  "IMPROVEMENTS": [
    "Bastion's autoplay will now play daily hits instead of weekly hits. Daily music listeners won't get bored of the same songs anymore.",
    "AFK messages will be shown even if a user's status is set to *Online* or *DND*."
  ],
  "KILLED THOSE BUGS": [
    "Fixed `showSpoiler` command not decoding the spoilers for you!",
    "Fixed an issue with auto-assignable roles being assigned at a delay if greet timeout was set.",
    "Fixed an issue that prevented the default greet & farewell messages from being shown. Bastion wanted to have a custom message for those. But not anymore!",
    "Fixed an issue that prevented your profile from being shown if you had more XP than Bastion expected from you. Won't happen anymore.",
    "Some under-the-hood fixes to make Bastion better!"
